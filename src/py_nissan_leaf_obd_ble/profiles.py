"""Vehicle generation profiles for Nissan Leaf OBD commands.

This module defines generation-specific command configurations for different
Nissan Leaf generations (ZE0, AZE0, ZE1).

Supported generations:
  - auto: Automatic mode (default) - includes both odometer sources for maximum compatibility
  - ze0: 2010-2017 Nissan Leaf (original)
  - aze0: 2017-2018 Nissan Leaf (minor refresh)
  - ze1: 2018+ Nissan Leaf (major redesign, currently ZE1 platform)

Each profile specifies:
  - which commands to enable/disable
  - any command-specific overrides
  - generation-specific quirks

When a generation is selected via async_get_data(generation="ze1"),
the API will apply the appropriate profile's overrides to the default
command table.

The "auto" profile is recommended for existing integrations as it ensures
backwards compatibility by including both active and passive odometer sources.
Users can optionally specify their vehicle generation for optimized command sets.
